      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Tech bro with a girlfriend?? That&amp;rsquo;s impossible. However, at one point in time, I would like to say I broke this standard by having a girlfriend for 2 years!

Well let me tell you all about that!&#xA;!&lt;img src=&#34;https://localhost:1313/images/heart.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://localhost:1313/image/common-404.webp&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
