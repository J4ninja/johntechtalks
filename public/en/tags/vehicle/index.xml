      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;electric-skating-as-a-beginner-skater&#34;&gt;Electric Skating as a Beginner Skater&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have never properly skated on a normal skateboard. My body won&amp;rsquo;t let me attempt dangerous things where I am not in complete control. That&amp;rsquo;s where the electric board controller comes in. With this controller, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to know the exact speed I am moving at and more importantly, stop when I have to. The only thing I would have to worry about is balance and turning. On the contrary, most skaters would just recommend getting a normal board so you can build confidence, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely my goal to be a real skater. I did my research and found an entry level electric board that wasn&amp;rsquo;t too pricey and didn&amp;rsquo;t have all the fancy features. I opted for the Backfire G2 Black since it was on sale and looked sleek while being aimed at beginners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
