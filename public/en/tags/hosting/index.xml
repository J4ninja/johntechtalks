Self-Hosting allows you to have full control over your apps and services. It teaches you how to run things privately, setting up things like nginx, systemd services, networking and more. It is also cost efficient since you only have to pay for the server cost. While, I enjoy not worrying about huge bills from cloud providers, I still miss having the convenience these hosting platforms provided. With some investigation, I came across Coolify.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
