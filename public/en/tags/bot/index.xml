      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-fallen-friend&#34;&gt;A Fallen Friend&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My fellow best friend Steve Le passed away on October 16, 2024. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go into details of his passing but he was my best friend, someone I knew for 10 years. We met playing Xbox during the 2012-2013 era. We mostly played games online and called for hours because I moved away to another state. We always supported each other&amp;rsquo;s goals and understood each other at a deep level. We made great memories going skydiving, shooting, playing videogames, and hanging out with our crew. His passing was so sudden and tragic. I desired to honor his memory in any way I knew how. Thus I created the Steve AI Discord Bot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
