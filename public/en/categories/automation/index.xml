Self-Hosting allows you to have full control over your apps and services. It teaches you how to run things privately, setting up things like nginx, systemd services, networking and more. It is also cost efficient since you only have to pay for the server cost. While, I enjoy not worrying about huge bills from cloud providers, I still miss having the convenience these hosting platforms provided. With some investigation, I came across Coolify.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hostinger-automation-with-git&#34;&gt;Hostinger Automation with Git&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://johnstechlogs.com/images/hostingerlogo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hostinger is a great and cheap hosting platform for static websites. I currently use the web hosting plan to host several websites. To deploy my website changes, I export my static content (html, css, js) into a zip and unzip it in the file manager&amp;rsquo;s public_html folder. This is a little cumbersome so I looked for a way to &lt;strong&gt;automate&lt;/strong&gt; this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately this can be done easily. Hostinger has an official tutorial for deploying git repos &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/1583302-how-to-deploy-a-git-repository&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://johnstechlogs.com/images/hostingergitpanel.png&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&#xA;However, this step alone won&amp;rsquo;t work on my web apps built with frameworks such as React, Next, and Hugo. I need another automation step.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
