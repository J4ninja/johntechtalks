A Tech bro with a girlfriend?? That's impossible. However, at one point in time, I would like to say I broke this standard by having a girlfriend for 2 years! Now as a nerdy tech bro, I am often consumed with learning new tech stacks and building personal projects. How can a tech bro even maintain their life while keeping their girlfriend happy?
