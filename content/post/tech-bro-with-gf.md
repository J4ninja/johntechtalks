A Tech bro with a girlfriend?? That's impossible. However, at one point in time, I would like to say I broke this standard by having a girlfriend for 2 years! Now as a nerdy tech bro, I am often consumed with learning new tech stacks and building personal projects. How can a tech bro even maintain their life while keeping their girlfriend happy? Well let me tell you all about that!

## Projects Designed with 'Her' in Mind

One of the best ways to leverage your skills and let your girlfriend feel special is by designing projects for her. One cheesy example is on Valentine's Day, design a web page that will ask her to be your valentine. Spice it up with your personality, inside jokes, or any current trends. In early 2024, the toothless dragon dance was trending so I added a gif to my page. Maybe you're familiar with another field such as game design. In that case, design a little mini game for her to play!

## Big Tech Means Big Bucks

If you're working in Big Tech (I'm not) then that means you must be making the big bucks. This really comes in handy. Let's say you get in an argument with your girlfriend. One thing you can do with your money is buy her some flowers or chocolate. If that doesn't work, just give her your credit card and see what happens. If money doesn't solve your problems, then you're screwed! 

## Love Language: Gift Giving in Tech 

What's a gift that only a tech bro would provide? For me, I chose to 3D-print a flower vase using my company's free 3D printer. With all those flowers I ended up having to buy for her, I figured she could use a vase. I found a pre-made stl file, uploaded it to the printer, picked out a nice filament color and voila! Unfortunately, the vase had a minor water leak so she just uses it for dead flowers now :( . One of my favorite things to 3D print is figures so I also had to print her a little cinnamoroll figure. Anyway, there's countless other ideas such as a new custom (MECHANICAL) keyboard for her, robot vacuum, drone, wireless charger, headphones, etc.

## Remote Jobs 

The best perk in the tech industry is working remote. I am able to work remote for 1-2 days a week and I can choose whenever this happens during the week. Whenever, I am not spending enough time with my girlfriend, "working" remote is the best solution. This way we get to stay in each other's presence without reducing productivity (somewhat). 

## Tech Date Ideas

If your girlfriend is interested in what you're interested in, then tech date ideas might be a great shot!

## Co-op Couple's Videogames

As a tech bro, you probably grew up playing games. Well if you're still into gaming, why not make your hobby a fun way to spend time with your girlfriend (and get her into gaming if she isn't)? Often I look for co-op games that we can play. If there aren't any, I play single player titles that she might enjoy watching on stream. In my case, we were both interested in the lore of Wukong so playing Black Myth Wukong was a blast to play and analyze!

### Couple's Games

1. It Takes Two
2. Spiritfarer
3. Stardew Valley
4. Overcooked 2
5. Unravel
6. Pico Park
7. Escape Room Simulator
8. Puzzle Games

## Are you an Algorithm? - Because You've Optimized my Happiness

At the end of the day, being in a relationship is a lot to handle for anyone. As a tech bro, your likeliness in obtaining a girlfriend is near 0 but not impossible. But it doesn't stop at getting a girlfriend. Your partner deserves to be a priority in your life and they should feel that way. I personally struggled with sticking to my productivity routine with a relationship. Still, having a girlfriend stabilized my mental health, knowing that I have a supporter in all my big ideas. However, I often took this for granted, only focusing on my endeavors and not her. It's great to have someone interested in your life, but hopefully you are at least equally interested in her life and make an effort to do the activities that she is interested in. We should put as much effort (and more) into our relationship as we do for interview prep. Use your talents as a tech bro and optimize your relationship!
