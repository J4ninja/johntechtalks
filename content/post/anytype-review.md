## The Competition
I haven't been really into the note taking game, especially typed notes. In my opinion, handwriting and digital handwritten notes are superior ways to reinforce concepts while studying. However, outside of class, I wanted a place to hold notes for travel plans, content ideas, finance, course schedules, gym progress and more. Notion offered the most visually appealing notes and kept my devices synced over cloud. Obsidian offered privacy by keeping your notes local and synced using Git or Apply iCloud. Even though I am fine writing notes in Markdown and using extensions (coming from a programmer's background), I did not enjoy Obsidian's syncing. I have an iPad, iPhone, and Windows desktop which made it complicated to use Git or iCloud on all devices. Notion had better syncing options but I have seen many examples where Notion is capable of deleting your old notes. 


## Ditching the Cloud
Here comes Anytype. This application is offline-first, keeping all your notes locally stored. It syncs seemlessly through peer to peer to all devices on the same network. It has support for Windows, Mac, IOS, and Android. It is visually appealing and allows you to import Notion templates! This was promised son of Notion and Obsidian! No more worrying about the cloud deleting my data or going through loopholes to sync my data. Any device that has your vault key phrase on the same network would automatically sync your notes. No online user accounts needed! Check out the full app at https://anytype.io/ .

## How I'm using Anytype
As mentioned in the app name, you can use it for anything. Thus, I split up my notes into my course schedule, books to read, gym progress, finance sheet, and a trip planner. The app does have a bit of a learning curve considering that it has its own techincal jargon and the app is still in beta (meaning some terms may change). However, I am currently pleased with its features such as code blocks, Latex support, data graphs, checkboxes, tables, and more. 


### Course Schedule 
First, I created a course type with properties for semester taken. Here I layed out a tile grid view of all my courses. I tagged which semester I took each course and I added a view to see group all the courses by semester.

### Course Notes
Within each course, I write different pages for my notes. For example, below, I wrote some bullet points on LangChain with text highlighting, a code block and an image diagram.

### Book Reader
For books, I wanted to track what I read so far and wanted to read next. I created a book type to hold properties for author names, page numbers, genre, and whether I read it or not. This way I can filter out the books to read while also showing how much I've read.

### Finance Tracker
For finance, I wanted to track my predicable monthly spending. I created a table to track investments, savings, fixed costs, and guilt-free spending. Unfortunately, spreadsheet functionality is extremely limited and I had to compute values manually unlock an Excel sheet. There is some formula integration by like averaging or summing an entire column, but there is no formula writing for column derivation. Hopefully that will be a full feature in the future.

## Conclusion
These were just a few examples of how I am taking notes. My needs of having offline support, seemless syncing, and aesthetically pleasing UI have been met. The app is beautifully designed with many cutting-edge features. I look forward to future updates and its 1.0.0 release!
