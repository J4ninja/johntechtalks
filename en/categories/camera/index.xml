      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-best-beginners-film-camera&#34;&gt;The Best Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Film Camera&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen those vintage and grainy looking photos on social media. You can replicate that with any old filter but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel authentic since it was digitally crafted. Film is simply thin strips that store images after being exposed to light. I was chasing the authenticity. My first experience with film cameras was using a disposable kodak camera. It was fun using a point and shoot and anticipating how it would come out after I went to get it developed. I feel that film photos really shine when people are just being themselves and having fun. Of course the disposable had no use once the roll was out. Then I came across the Kodak Ektar 35. This was a reusable film camera from Kodak. This meant I could get the same point and shoot feeling, keep the camera, and reuse it by refilling the rolls. I loved the way the body looked with its vintage aesthetic. I&amp;rsquo;ve received compliments about it in public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
