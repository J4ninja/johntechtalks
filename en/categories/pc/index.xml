      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-a-pc&#34;&gt;Building a PC&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never completely built a PC by myself. I knew building your own was cheaper than buying prebuilts. In 2020, I wanted to move away from using an external GPU dock for my laptop to a desktop. I had a lot of fun picking out the parts for my new system. When it came to building it, people always said it was like building legos and I loved legos. However, I am not the best when it comes to hardware or cable management. I had a friend come over and help me build my desktop. Unfortunately, he took over most of the process and I felt like I missed out. The build was a success and it&amp;rsquo;s lasted me five years. Now that I have a solid income, I think it&amp;rsquo;s time for an upgrade.&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://johnstechlogs.com/images/miniitxpc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image Description&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
