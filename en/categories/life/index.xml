      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-best-beginners-film-camera&#34;&gt;The Best Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Film Camera&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen those vintage and grainy looking photos on social media. You can replicate that with any old filter but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel authentic since it was digitally crafted. Film is simply thin strips that store images after being exposed to light. I was chasing the authenticity. My first experience with film cameras was using a disposable kodak camera. It was fun using a point and shoot and anticipating how it would come out after I went to get it developed. I feel that film photos really shine when people are just being themselves and having fun. Of course the disposable had no use once the roll was out. Then I came across the Kodak Ektar 35. This was a reusable film camera from Kodak. This meant I could get the same point and shoot feeling, keep the camera, and reuse it by refilling the rolls. I loved the way the body looked with its vintage aesthetic. I&amp;rsquo;ve received compliments about it in public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;electric-skating-as-a-beginner-skater&#34;&gt;Electric Skating as a Beginner Skater&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have never properly skated on a normal skateboard. My body won&amp;rsquo;t let me attempt dangerous things where I am not in complete control. That&amp;rsquo;s where the electric board controller comes in. With this controller, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to know the exact speed I am moving at and more importantly, stop when I have to. The only thing I would have to worry about is balance and turning. On the contrary, most skaters would just recommend getting a normal board so you can build confidence, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely my goal to be a real skater. I did my research and found an entry level electric board that wasn&amp;rsquo;t too pricey and didn&amp;rsquo;t have all the fancy features. I opted for the Backfire G2 Black since it was on sale and looked sleek while being aimed at beginners.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Tech bro with a girlfriend?? That&amp;rsquo;s impossible. However, at one point in time, I would like to say I broke this standard by having a girlfriend for 2 years! Now as a nerdy tech bro, I am often consumed with learning new tech stacks and building personal projects. How can a tech bro even maintain their life while keeping their girlfriend happy? Well let me tell you all about that!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
