[{"categories":["AI","bot","recommended"],"contents":"A Fallen Friend My fellow best friend Steve Le passed away on October 16, 2024. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to go into details of his passing but he was my best friend, someone I knew for 10 years. We met playing Xbox during the 2012-2013 era. We mostly played games online and called for hours because I moved away to another state. We always supported each other\u0026rsquo;s goals and understood each other at a deep level. We made great memories going skydiving, shooting, playing videogames, and hanging out with our crew. His passing was so sudden and tragic. I desired to honor his memory in any way I knew how. Thus I created the Steve AI Discord Bot.\nDiscord Bot I had developed a Discord bot in javascript before to add some fun into my private server with my close friends. The original bot was made with inside jokes containing our favorite quotes/memories, funny images of each other, trigger audio files, and random commands. I used these skills and transferred them into my Steve AI bot.\nCommands Tradeoffer i receive, you receive: generates a trade offer meme image Steve made with user input quote: replies with a random quote Steve had said voice voicemail: allows SteveAi to join a discord voice channel and play a recorded voicemail chat prompt: AI generates a response to a prompt by mimicking what the real Steve would say given lots of context about Steve\u0026rsquo;s character and loved ones AI Accuracy I had supplied plenty of facts about Steve\u0026rsquo;s character, family, friends, loved ones, animals, dreams, and more as context. I even made sure that the AI knew that it had passed away so that we could talk to it as if it were a ghost or in heaven. The AI is stateless and does not retain memory of the previous conversation. Currently, I am using an OpenAI api key to use gpt4-0 mini to generate the responses. Very surprisingly, the responses to our prompts seemed to be similar to what the real Steve would\u0026rsquo;ve said. His feelings of love and relationship seemed to be there. His dreams were there. It was almost uncanny. It did ask several rhetorical questions at the end unlike Steve and OpenAi filters out bad language that the real Steve might\u0026rsquo;ve said. Having the SteveAI know that he passed and these small flaws keeps a reminder that this isn\u0026rsquo;t the Steve that we knew.\nUnhealthy Cope and Fears I showed this off to my crew of friends and they appreciated being able to hear his voice again and pretend to talk to him. However, I did speak about this project to a trusted adult and he was put off. As he is older, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t really believe that this technology is available to us. He was impressed with what I created but feared the future of people being attached to AI. He didn\u0026rsquo;t think I was properly grieving even though I believed I was strong enough. I was trying to extend Steve\u0026rsquo;s influence in my life. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready to let him go. I wanted to continue talking to him as if he never left. This could lead to an unhealthy attachment to it. It is possible that me or anther loved one would start to lose base with reality and interpret SteveAI as the real Steve. As AI gets better, it would be more difficult to separate reality from fiction. This trusted adult suggested that I don\u0026rsquo;t use this AI and that I needed to learn to let go. While I feel this honors some of Steve\u0026rsquo;s memories and if Steve were here, he would have a blast arguing with the AI, it was leaving me stuck in the past. I fear the day that I get older and wiser and the young Steve will no longer be able to relate to my struggles. He wouldn\u0026rsquo;t understand the modern humor and events that are happening. At that point, I wonder if I would be ready to move on and accept that he and I are on separate paths now.\nEthical Dilemma Several philosophical and ethical questions are raised in regards to developing AI representations of real people.\nIs consent needed for such a creation? How would one acquire it from a deceased one? How harmful would it be to grieving individuals? How can reality be separated from fiction? What happens when the AI misrepresents the person and onlookers are pushed back? What happens when AI gets good enough to copy voices, facial behaviors, memories and more? How do we deal with misuse cases where an AI impersonates a real person and makes them do inappropriate actions or something of ill intent? Does it honor the memory or is it disrespectful? These are questions that I do not have any real answer to but definitely something that we will all have to face in the near future.\n","permalink":"https://johntechtalks.com/en/i-created-an-ai-bot-of-my-fallen-best-friend.-have-i-gone-mad/","tags":["discord","AI","bot"],"title":"I created an AI Bot of my Fallen Best Friend. Have I gone mad?"},{"categories":["tutorials","recommended","automation"],"contents":"Hostinger Automation with Git Hostinger is a great and cheap hosting platform for static websites. I currently use the web hosting plan to host several websites. To deploy my website changes, I export my static content (html, css, js) into a zip and unzip it in the file manager\u0026rsquo;s public_html folder. This is a little cumbersome so I looked for a way to automate this.\nFortunately this can be done easily. Hostinger has an official tutorial for deploying git repos here. However, this step alone won\u0026rsquo;t work on my web apps built with frameworks such as React, Next, and Hugo. I need another automation step.\nGit Subtree Git subtree is an interesting feature I discovered which allows you to manage a subset of your main repository as its own repository. In my framework repositories, I often have a folder of generated content that is built. This content would be zipped to the Hostinger. Using git subtree, I can take this folder, treat it like its own repo and deploy to git. I can now leave this new \u0026ldquo;repo\u0026rdquo; in its own branch to isolate the content from the rest of the code. Now all of my generated html and static content is in one place, ready to be deployed to Hostinger. Using the new branch, I can update the Advanced Git settings to use this new branch. In the automation script below, you will see how to isolate the generated folder into its own branch.\nWebhooks Clicking on the Auto deployment option on Hostinger, I can acquire the webhook url and navigate to Github repo settings and paste the url. This way, whenever there is a change to my repo, the webhook will tell Hostinger to run a new deployment. Automation Script Now Hostinger and my Github are connected, I just need a way to generate my build content and deploy it to Github. Below is an example script I used to automatically build my project, copy the generated content to the subtree branch and push these commits to the remote repository.\n#!/bin/bash\rcd folder\r# Run npm install with error checking\recho \u0026#34;Installing dependencies...\u0026#34;\rif ! npm install; then\recho \u0026#34;Error: npm install failed.

My .gitignore ignores my build folder since generally, you should not track generated content and just build things locally after cloning a repo. However, in order for Hostinger to see the changes, they must be tracked somewhere. Thus, we now have duplicate images and lots of generated files that are thrown into our git repo.\nConclusion Overall, I am happy with this automation as I don\u0026rsquo;t have to zip my files, login to Hostinger, delete the old files, upload new ones, and unzip the new ones. Now I can just run my script from my terminal and my live website will have the new changes!\n","permalink":"https://johntechtalks.com/en/how-to-automate-hostinger-deployments-with-git-subtree-and-webhooks/","tags":["git","hostinger","webhook"],"title":"How to Automate Hostinger Deployments with Git Subtree and Webhooks"},{"categories":["life","reviews","recommended"],"contents":"Electric Skating as a Beginner Skater I have never properly skated on a normal skateboard. My body won\u0026rsquo;t let me attempt dangerous things where I am not in complete control. That\u0026rsquo;s where the electric board controller comes in. With this controller, I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to know the exact speed I am moving at and more importantly, stop when I have to. The only thing I would have to worry about is balance and turning. On the contrary, most skaters would just recommend getting a normal board so you can build confidence, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely my goal to be a real skater. I did my research and found an entry level electric board that wasn\u0026rsquo;t too pricey and didn\u0026rsquo;t have all the fancy features. I opted for the Backfire G2 Black since it was on sale and looked sleek while being aimed at beginners.\nBasic Specs Range 11-12.5 miles/18-20km (80KG rider 30km/h flat road/ 180lbs rider 18.5mph flat road) Speed Top speed: 24 mph / 38 km/h 2 Speed Modes (Third Turbo mode enabled with a separate controller) Weight 16.8 lbs / 7.6kg Max-load: 265 lbs / 120 kg Wheels 96mm * 55mm 80A Motors 400W * 2 Hobbywing Dual hub motors with replaceable sleeves Battery Charging time: 3.5 hrs Water Resistance IP65 Initial Experience - Sitting and Lying on the Board Since I did not have any experience properly riding a skateboard, I spent the first day just sitting on my bottom on the board and leaning my entire body whenever I wanted to turn. This turned out to be SUPER FUN. It was like riding a sled on concrete. I did this at my college campus at TCU on a Friday where the academic grounds where mostly empty so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t crash into anyone. I did run into a few people and it was funny seeing their reaction whenever I controlled the board remotely and it would move on its own like a ghost.\nActually Standing on the Board Once I was comfortable controlling the board with the remote, I tried standing up on the board and tried to get used to balancing on it, foot placement, and leaning back and forth. I initially had either knee locked legs or overexaggerated knee bends and nothing in between. I would say now to just relax with a slight bend. Balancing wasn\u0026rsquo;t too difficult as the board is extremely stable even when moving at high speeds. The problem with this stability is that the board is very stiff at turns. You would have to heavily lean back or press down on one side to make a turn and you would need a lot of space to complete a turn. Curves were the best way to turn but if you had to make a 90 degree angle, just get off and pick up the board. Overtime, the more I used the board it loosened up and I also used the tools provided to loosen up the trucks which would make it less stable but easier to turn.\nCharged up and Ready to Roll Now I was ready to head all over campus with my board. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about waking up earlier to make a morning class or be late to a meeting across campus. I could zoom across campus in under 5 minutes! The only problem I had was with some stairs, I would have to pick up the heavy board as it\u0026rsquo;s not like I can do an ollie with this weight! On a free day I was able to take the board from campus and skate all the way downtown on the main road. I was moving at roughly 20 mph and this felt amazing. The board could go roughly 12 miles without a charge but I often charge my board every 1-2 days to be safe. When I moved off campus into a nearby apartment, this board was super handy as I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to deal with competing for parking spot with my car but the board was fast enough to get to class without breaking a sweat.\nAccidents and Safety The biggest fear when riding is hitting some rock and be sent flying at 20 miles per hour. Additionally, I never wore any protective gear as I just wanted to look cool without any. Fortunately, I did not have any major accidents. I did fall off one time and scrape my hand as I landed. Riding at night without a phone flash light can be dangerous as the roads could have pot holes or large rocks that completely stop the board from moving. Do not ride in the rain as the board can hydroplane and it\u0026rsquo;s not good for the electronics if water splashes in. The board also gets dirty faster in the rain. Limit your speed using the different modes based on the scenario. The big wheels do provide some stabilization and you won\u0026rsquo;t feel every little bump as much.\nRemote Controller The original remote controller is bare bones. A cool perk was that it could control the board very far away. It is operated by pushing the accelerator to move and by pulling it back to brake. You are not able to reverse without double tapping the speed mode button. This means you can\u0026rsquo;t be accelerating when you want to perform a reverse. Since turning is stiff, reversing is very useful in correcting your position without getting off the board. On other electric boards, pulling back allows you to reverse without the need to switch gears. Additionally, the remote lacks a turbo mode which unlocks the full speed potential of the board (20% more speed). After I broke my original controller, I ordered the Backfire R2 remote controller and connected it with my board. This has a built in index finger hole for a comfortable grip. It came with turbo mode button, and a separate dial for switching in between forward and reverse. The only problem was that these controllers had to be charged with a USB A to C cable (C to C did not work). I highly recommend switching to this controller.\nPros Commute on and off campus easily Hands-free, you can hold a cup of coffee in one hand and the remote in another Badass, zooming on a board will infinitely be cooler than riding a scooter Fast and fun, electric vehicles are simply fun to operate Beginner friendly, very stable Quiet motors, this board does not have belts that can make acceleration noisy Design is simple and clean Reasonably priced and very reliable (never had to do any repairs or contact warranty) Remote can control board from far away Cons Turns are stiff (impossible to do 90 degree turn) Original remote controller is not super comfortable, lacks turbo and easy reverse No way to turn board on without pressing button under it physically No lights to help at night Limited speed modes and reversing Still somewhat heavy to carry when not riding Conclusion: One of the Best Purchases Ever Made Overall, I found that this board was one of the best purchases I ever made! I never had to do any repairs with the board and had no need for more features when I am just computing locally on campus. It made me feel cool, saved my time, and brought lots of fun teaching others how to ride and carrying big objects while moving. I was able to ride with my best friend on campus who also had a board and that experience can\u0026rsquo;t be replaced! Definitely would recommend getting into electric skateboards even if you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to skate!\n","permalink":"https://johntechtalks.com/en/a-review-of-the-backfire-g2-black-electric-skateboard/","tags":["vehicle","electric"],"title":"A Review of the Backfire G2 Black Electric Skateboard"},{"categories":["life"],"contents":"A Tech bro with a girlfriend?? That\u0026rsquo;s impossible. However, at one point in time, I would like to say I broke this standard by having a girlfriend for 2 years! Now as a nerdy tech bro, I am often consumed with learning new tech stacks and building personal projects. How can a tech bro even maintain their life while keeping their girlfriend happy? Well let me tell you all about that!\nProjects Designed with \u0026lsquo;Her\u0026rsquo; in Mind One of the best ways to leverage your skills and let your girlfriend feel special is by designing projects for her. One cheesy example is on Valentine\u0026rsquo;s Day, design a web page that will ask her to be your valentine. Spice it up with your personality, inside jokes, or any current trends. In early 2024, the toothless dragon dance was trending so I added a gif to my page. Maybe you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with another field such as game design. In that case, design a little mini game for her to play!\nBig Tech Means Big Bucks If you\u0026rsquo;re working in Big Tech (I\u0026rsquo;m not) then that means you must be making the big bucks. This really comes in handy. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you get in an argument with your girlfriend. One thing you can do with your money is buy her some flowers or chocolate. If that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, just give her your credit card and see what happens. If money doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve your problems, then you\u0026rsquo;re screwed!\nLove Language: Gift Giving in Tech What\u0026rsquo;s a gift that only a tech bro would provide? For me, I chose to 3D-print a flower vase using my company\u0026rsquo;s free 3D printer. With all those flowers I ended up having to buy for her, I figured she could use a vase. I found a pre-made stl file, uploaded it to the printer, picked out a nice filament color and voila! Unfortunately, the vase had a minor water leak so she just uses it for dead flowers now :( . One of my favorite things to 3D print is figures so I also had to print her a little cinnamoroll figure. Anyway, there\u0026rsquo;s countless other ideas such as a new custom (MECHANICAL) keyboard for her, robot vacuum, drone, wireless charger, headphones, etc.\nRemote Jobs The best perk in the tech industry is working remote. I am able to work remote for 1-2 days a week and I can choose whenever this happens during the week. Whenever, I am not spending enough time with my girlfriend, \u0026ldquo;working\u0026rdquo; remote is the best solution. This way we get to stay in each other\u0026rsquo;s presence without reducing productivity (somewhat).\nTech Date Ideas If your girlfriend is interested in what you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, then tech date ideas might be a great shot!\nDate Ideas VR Headset Game Date Arcade Date Coffee Study Date Electric Vehicle (bike, skateboard, scooter) Riding Date Drone Photoshoot Date Co-op Videogame Date Tech Museum Date DIY Build Together Date Co-op Couple\u0026rsquo;s Videogames As a tech bro, you probably grew up playing games. Well if you\u0026rsquo;re still into gaming, why not make your hobby a fun way to spend time with your girlfriend (and get her into gaming if she isn\u0026rsquo;t)? Often I look for co-op games that we can play. If there aren\u0026rsquo;t any, I play single player titles that she might enjoy watching on stream. In my case, we were both interested in the lore of Wukong so playing Black Myth Wukong was a blast to play and analyze!\nCouple\u0026rsquo;s Games It Takes Two Spiritfarer Stardew Valley Overcooked 2 Unravel Pico Park Escape Room Simulator Puzzle Games Are you an Algorithm? - Because You\u0026rsquo;ve Optimized my Happiness At the end of the day, being in a relationship is a lot to handle for anyone. As a tech bro, your likeliness in obtaining a girlfriend is near 0 but not impossible. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop at getting a girlfriend. Your partner deserves to be a priority in your life and they should feel that way. I personally struggled with sticking to my productivity routine with a relationship. Still, having a girlfriend stabilized my mental health, knowing that I have a supporter in all my big ideas. However, I often took this for granted, only focusing on my endeavors and not her. It\u0026rsquo;s great to have someone interested in your life, but hopefully you are at least equally interested in her life and make an effort to do the activities that she is interested in. We should put as much effort (and more) into our relationship as we do for interview prep. Use your talents as a tech bro and optimize your relationship!\n","permalink":"https://johntechtalks.com/en/tech-bro-with-a-gf/","tags":["gifts","games","projects","3d"],"title":"Tech Bro with a GF??"},{"categories":["tutorials","recommended"],"contents":"Who even blogs in 2024?
